# DeepL Translate Github Action

> üèÜ v1.0.0 of this github action was awarded the [Grand Prize of Maintainer must-haves category in the GitHub + DEV 2023 Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/github-dev-2023-hackathon-winners-announced-236o)

## Intro

This action uses the [DeepL Translate API](https://github.com/DeepLcom/deepl-node) to translate files in your repository to any target languages supported by DeepL. 
Since DeepL API does not officially support markdown tag handling yet, this github action helps to mitigate some issues that DeepL may have when it comes to `.md` documents.

‚ú® In v1.0.0, **common text files** such as `.md | .html | .xml | .txt` are supported.

‚ú® From v2.0.0 onwards, flat **locale JSON** files are also supported.

‚ú® From v2.1.0 onwards, nested **locale JSON** files are also supported.

## Example usage

### For standard text files such as `.md`, `.html`, `.xml`, `.txt`

```yaml
name: Translate documents from docs/simple folder
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: DeepL Translate Github Action
        uses: lyqht/deepl-translate-github-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          target_languages: zh,ja
          input_file_path: docs/simple/original.md
          output_file_name_prefix: docs/simple/
          deepl_api_key: ${{ secrets.DEEPL_API_KEY }}
```

With this workflow, you will get `docs/simple/zh.md` and `docs/simple/ja.md`

### For locale json

```yaml
name: Translate locales json
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: DeepL Translate Github Action
        uses: lyqht/deepl-translate-github-action@v2.0.0
        with:
          target_languages: fr,ja
          input_file_path: locales/en.json
          output_file_name_prefix: locales/
          deepl_api_key: ${{ secrets.DEEPL_API_KEY }}
```

With this workflow, you will get `locales/fr.json`, `locales/ja.json`.
